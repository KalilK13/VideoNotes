Unit tests verify the functionality of small code units, such as a class, method, or function, ensuring they work as intended. They offer immediate feedback on the code's correctness and help catch bugs early. Additionally, unit tests serve as documentation and aid in creating clear, maintainable code.
Configuring JUnit 5 in IntelliJ and Eclipse is simple; it mainly involves setting up test classes or methods and letting the IDE handle the required dependencies. Writing unit tests includes preparing the test environment, running the code under test, and checking the results using assertions.
Common assertions in JUnit tests include assertNotNull and assertEquals, which verify whether the code behaves as expected. IDEs can execute tests and provide immediate feedback on code correctness. When tests fail, they offer valuable insights into potential code issues, helping developers troubleshoot and fix problems efficiently.
Demonstrating Assertions:
Introducing a failure in a test and observing the outcome helps understand test behavior.
The assertSame assertion compares object references to verify if two variables point to the same object in memory.
Features such as appointments in the ClinicCalendar class can be tested using assertTrue and assertFalse assertions.
Assertions for collections:
Using assertEquals to compare collections and assertIterableEquals to compare iterables.
These assertions help ensure collections contain expected values and sequences.
The importance of assertions:
Assertions are crucial in verifying code and maintaining confidence, especially during code refactoring.
Refactoring, such as extracting data pattern conversion logic, improves code readability and maintainability.
Executing all tests after refactoring:
Ensures that no regressions or unexpected changes occur due to modifications.
Proper test coverage is vital to maintain code quality and integrity.
